# TechnicalFeasibilityReport
This is a feasibility report on developing medical cloud solution using web and mobile technologies to analyse absence seizures in children


This feasibility report on developing medical cloud solution using web and mobile technologies to analyse absence seizures in 
children considers the following key ICT aspects:
•	Front-end development -  functional and non-functional requirements and wireframes.
•	Back-end development -  a relational database design model with an ER diagram by capturing entity, attributes, 
	describing their relationships, adding foreign key constraints, and using normalisation techniques. 
	It also involves suggestions on the use of possible data analysis techniques, a discussion about a suitable medical cloud hosting solution 
  for the application and a solution diagram.
•	Medical data cannot be discussed without the data privacy and security issues. So, the feasibility report includes
	a discussion about all the threats to data security and privacy of user’s data and how to avoid them. 
	For e.g., include encryption, authentication, authorization etc. It also includes a discussion on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
•	Finally this report includes a  brief discussion of the likely impact of the application when developed. 	
	For e.g., how parents could be empowered positively as well as the negative impacts on children if the application was not used appropriately by parents.
